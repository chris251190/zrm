                will serve as your resource. {"\n"}{"\n"}

                Tune out the rational part of your brain for the moment and let your intuition take over for
                this task. Choose the picture that gives you a strong, positive feeling (makes you feel happy or calm,
                makes you smile, etc.).{"\n"}{"\n"}

                You donâ€™t have to understand why the picture gives you such a good feeling. You
                will see one picture at a time and the series of pictures will be presented twice. Just pay attention to
                which picture gives you an especially good feeling. {"\n"}{"\n"}

                At the end of each run-through, you will see an
                overview of all of the pictures. Then you can compare all of the pictures and check which one you like
                the best.
